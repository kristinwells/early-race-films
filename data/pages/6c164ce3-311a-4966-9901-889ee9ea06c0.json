Many Black Native people, regardless of deep community ties, were placed on the Freedmen roll. Their allotments became prime targets for speculators who used forged deeds, guardianships, and courtroom maneuvers to pry mineral rights away for pennies on the dollar. After statehood, when Indian Territory became what is now known as Oklahoma, US American segregation practices and laws fixed those racial categories into everyday life, dictating where people could live, attend school, ride streetcars, or marry. Many Black Natives left the state, some of whom settled in places such as California, along with the thousands of African Americans from the south, who moved north and west during the Great Migration. "

His scheme dramatizes the intersection of race, property, and fraud which divested thousands of Native Americans—including those with Black ancestry—of their land. Romero’s desperate dash to file paperwork before the courthouse closes echoes the cut-throat race for deeds and leases that decided fortunes in early twentieth century Oklahoma. While many depictions of these events frame them solely through the lens of White/Native relations, the film offers a rare contemporary Black perspective on how allotment policy, legal bureaucracy, and settler colonialism combined to dispossess both Native and Black citizens.  "

The mere suspicion that she might be “Colored” (Black) is enough to compel her to depart from her adoptive household. Meanwhile, the intersection of her racial status and political status as a Muscogee Freedmen makes her a target of a scheme to steal her land. The film’s characters—Black hero, Mexican American villain, white (possibly Native) guardian, and Native/Black heir—thus map onto a landscape where segregation hardened, blood quantum came to reshape definitions of tribal citizenship, and economic opportunity flowed toward those who manipulated the new racial bureaucracy that arrived with the Curtis Act and statehood.  "
